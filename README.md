# [ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)

A website for IITG students to compare academic performance with peers. Implemented institute email login and verification of email to prevent abuse.

Students are asked to enter their roll number. Name, branch, tutorial group and institute email are then parsed from data provided by IITG, and a verification link is sent to that email. After verification, a new account is created for that student.

Exam details are uploaded by moderators, and students are asked to enter their marks. After a student enters their marks, they are given access to the statistics for that exam like maximum marks obtained, average marks (averaged over all the students, branch, and tutorial group.)
