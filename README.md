# [ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)

**[ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)**, A Word which carries an immense amount of potential, love and connection with it, but yet no meaning. Yeah **[ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)** means nothing.

## Then what is [ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)??

**[ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)** has been created with a futuristic vision. It has been created to evolve in a way that it becomes the Go-to-Place for every need of IITG Junta.

## But that's all about the future right?? How does [ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/) help me now?

All of us have been putting a lot of effort into acads(:coughs: ahem ahem). Be it quizzes, exams or even pre-tuts, we take everything seriously. (coz seniors told "CPI sabse important hai bhay").

## But how do you assess your performance? There's no data about how well did others perform.

I was satisfied with 6 marks in EE quiz knowing that my friends must have scored near about same, until I realized my branch peeps have scored even 9 and 9.5. :angryjealousface:
              
That's where **[ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)** steps in.
**[ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)** provides you with valuable stats that will help you assess your performance in every exam.
Our Coordinator Obliged to Distinguish and Evaluate Stats will process the input from the students and provide you with the needful info.

All we expect from you is to provide us with legit data about your performance as the whole working structure of **[ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/)** relies upon user input.
              
With that :tearyeyes:, We feel proud to say, that **"[ERTOPE](https://letsintegreat.github.io/ertope/) IS ALL YOURS"**, Nurture it like your own kid.


*btw Coordinator Obliged to Distinguish and Evaluate Stats is just a piece of code, lmao.*
